title: Audio Client Helper
description: Higher-order wrapper component that streamlines the use of the Pipecat Client SDK.
component: true
---

## Overview

The `AudioClientHelper` component provides convenience methods for using the Pipecat Client SDK.

- Creates a Pipecat Client instance and manages its lifecycle.
- Wraps children with the necessary providers (such as `ThemeProvider` and `PipecatClientProvider`).
- Provides connect and disconnect handlers.
- Passes through transport and client options to the Pipecat Client instance.
- Automatically disconnects the client when unmounting.
- Surfaces loading and error states.

Using this component helps cut down on boilerplate code that typically remains the same across most applications.

<Callout>
  This component creates the `PipecatClientProvider` context for you, so you
  don't need to create it yourself. Child components will be able to use all
  Pipecat Client SDK hooks and components.

## Usage

Helper components are typically used at the highest level of your application, and are used to wrap your entire application.

```tsx
import {
  AudioClientHelper,
  ErrorCard,
  LoaderSpinner,
} from "@pipecat-ai/voice-ui-kit";

export default function Home() {
  return (
    <AudioClientHelper
      transportType="smallwebrtc"
      connectParams={{
        connectionUrl: "/api/offer",
      }}
    >
      {({ handleConnect, handleDisconnect, loading, error }) =>
        loading ? (
          <LoaderSpinner />
        ) : error ? (
          <ErrorCard error={error} />
        ) : (
          /* Your app component */
        )
      }
    </AudioClientHelper>
  );
}
```
