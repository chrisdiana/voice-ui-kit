[0.2.0]

Various visual enhancements, primitve additions and CSS variables in support of more flexible theming.

To prep for shadcn registry components, utilities and variables are no longer built with a
Tailwind prefix (`vkui`). A scoped export still exists in the package for instances where style isolation matters.

- Added: out-of-the-box themes e.g [05-theme](examples/05-theme)
- Added: Badge primitive
- Added: Progress primitive
- Added: Divider
- Added: Additional card variants and decorations
- Added: `StripeLoader`
- Added: Component - `HighlightOverlay` that draws user attention to a particular UI element
- Added: TW4 utilities for shadow classes to allow overrides in external themes.
- Added: TW4 utilities for button sizing
- Change: `AudioClientHelper` renamed to `PipecatAppBase`.
    - Now accepts both React Node children as well as a functional list for prop injection. If passing renderables, client methods can be accessed directly on the context's client via Pipecat React hooks (e.g. `usePipecatClient`).
    - Added `noThemeProvider` prop to optionally disable theme provider wrapping.
    - Made connection handlers (`handleConnect`, `handleDisconnect`) compatible with both sync and async functions.
    - Enhanced error handling and loading states for better developer experience.
    - Returns the `client` object in child props.
    - Fixed TypeScript component type definition to resolve JSX usage errors.
- Change: `LoaderSpinner` component from `components/ui/loaders` has been renamed to `SpinLoader` to establish a naming convention for future loaders.
- Change: `Cards` primitive no longer pads based on media queries for flexibility
- Change: `css/components.css` and `css/utilities.css` split from main `index.css`
- Fixed: `tailwind-merge` needs extensions for custom shadow-* class names, which have no been applied.
- Fixed: CSS nits to address border overlap for button groups when in dark mode.
- Fixed: User audio control no longer shrinks when loading
