[0.2.0]

- `AudioClientHelper` renamed to `PipecatAppBase`. Previous name exported to prevent a breaking change, but will eventually be deprecated.
- `PipecatAppBase`
    - Now accepts both React Node children as well as a functional list for prop injection. If passing renderables, client methods can be accessed directly on the context's client via Pipecat React hooks (e.g. `usePipecatClient`).
    - Added `noThemeProvider` prop to optionally disable theme provider wrapping.
    - Made connection handlers (`handleConnect`, `handleDisconnect`) compatible with both sync and async functions.
    - Enhanced error handling and loading states for better developer experience.
    - Returns the client object in child props.
    - Fixed TypeScript component type definition to resolve JSX usage errors.
- `LoaderSpinner` component from `components/ui/loaders` has been renamed to `SpinLoader` to establish a naming convention for future loaders.
- Minor CSS fixes to address border overlap for button groups when in dark mode.
- `ErrorCard` allows for cascading classNames for Card elements and passing of custom icon component
- Added TW4 utilities to shadow classes to allow overrides in external themes
